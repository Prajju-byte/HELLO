TLE: Wwrite a java program to generate a random number using multiple threads 
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :Develop a Java program that implements a multi-threaded application with three threads.
 Each thread has a specific task as described as follows:
 First Thread (Random Number Generator): This thread generates a random integer every 1 second.
 Second Thread (Square Computation): This thread receives the random integer generated by the first thread
 and computes its square. After computing the square, it prints the result. 
 Third Thread (Cube Computation): This thread receives the random integer generated by the first thread and
 computes its cube. After computing the cube, it prints the result


import java.util.*;
class Square implements Runnable {
public int x;
public Square(int num) {
x = num;
}
public void run() {
System.out.println("Thread 2: Square of " + x + " is: " + x * x);
}
}
class Cube implements Runnable {
public int x;
public Cube(int num) {
x = num;
}
public void run() {
System.out.println("Thread 3: Cube of " + x + " is: " + x * x * x);
}
}
class GenerateNos implements Runnable {
public void run() {
int num = 0;
Random r = new Random();
try {
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
num = r.nextInt(100);
System.out.println("Thread 1: Generated random number is " + num);
Thread t1 = new Thread(new Square(num));
t1.start();
Thread t2 = new Thread(new Cube(num));
t2.start();
Thread.sleep(1000);
System.out.println("--------------------------------------");
}
} catch (Exception ex) {
System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
}
}
} // End of GenerateNos
public class pgm9_2 {

public static void main(String[] args) {
Thread t = new Thread(new GenerateNos());
t.start();
}
}
